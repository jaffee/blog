      <description>So you want to do an above ground pool pool  pool+filter pump https://www.walmart.com/ip/Intex-10-x-30-Metal-Frame-Above-Ground-Swimming-Pool-with-Filter-Pump/40720864 skimmer https://www.homedepot.com/p/Swimming-Pool-Skimmer-with-4-ft-to-8-ft-Telescoping-Pole-61297/203796251  This pool comes with a filter pump, which you pretty definitely need to keep the water moving and clean. You don&#39;t necessarily need it run it 24/7 though it might help? I don&#39;t really know... I run ours during the day most days and turn it off at night.
I don&#39;t have the skimmer yet, but feel like we definitely need it.</description>

      <description>Blergin&#39; I decided to make this as easy as possible - hugo, github pages, point an existing domain name at it, and call it a day.
but of course I have to decide on a theme, figure out how to use org mode instead of markdown. etc. etc.</description>
