Here's what I did... YMMV

# Pool
- [pool+filter pump](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Intex-10-x-30-Metal-Frame-Above-Ground-Swimming-Pool-with-Filter-Pump/40720864)
- [skimmer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Swimming-Pool-Skimmer-with-4-ft-to-8-ft-Telescoping-Pole-61297/203796251)

This pool comes with a filter pump, which you pretty definitely need
to keep the water moving and clean. You don't necessarily need it run
it 24/7 though it might help? I don't really know... I run ours during
the day most days and turn it off at night.

I don't have the skimmer yet, but feel like we definitely need
it... and that's with the pool under a screen tent (see below). I have
no idea how so much crap gets in. We may also need some kind of vacuum
situation as stuff tends to settle on the bottom... I'll see if the
skimmer is good enough to stir it up and pick it up though as getting
a vacuum for a 10' $100 pool seems a bit ridiculous.

# Screen Tent

This one is actually a tight fit for our 10' pool because of the way
the sides slope. I'd go with something larger if we did it again. You
want enough room to move around the edges of the pool inside the
screen, and ideally to put a chair or two in there.

# Chemicals
- [pH Down](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8BUBE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Shock?](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DP67F9E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [chlorine dispenser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M40VJM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [test strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6E9PG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [full test kit](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Taylor-K-1004-Safety-Plus-Swimming-Pool-Chlorine-Bromine-pH-Alkalinity-Test-Kit/39130941)
- [chlorine tablets](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Clorox-Pool-Spa-XtraBlue-1-Chlorinating-Tablets-3-75-lbs/116515810)
- baking soda (I needed 12 ounces)
- kitchen scale that can measure ounces/grams
- rubber gloves
- safety glasses

You don't need test strips *and* a test kit, but the strips are a
cheap and easy way to do quick tests to make sure everything is
kosher. The test kit is more accurate and gives more information when
your trying to get things dialed initially.

I haven't actually used the shock yet, and I think it might be
overkill for a pool of this size. The instructions tell you to do
things "per 10,000 gallons" and my pool is 1/10 that size...

For chlorine I find the tablets/dispenser convenient, but you can
also, I've heard, just put half a cup of bleach in every day
(ish). Bleach is a bit hard to come by these pandemic days, but the
tablets seem to be readily available.

I found that with our pool, the pH was high and the alkalinity was
low, so I bought the pH Down to lower the pH and put some baking soda
in to raise the alkalinity. You may find that your pH is low, or
alkalinity is high in which case you need different chemicals.

I recommend watching some youtube videos and such to learn about pH,
free chlorine and alkalinity. I used this [https://app.poolcalculator.com/](calculator) to figure out how
much of stuff to put in. You can figure out how many gallons your pool
is with some basic volume calculations and converting cubic feet to
gallons. Ours is a 10' cylinder 2.5 feet deep, which means the radius
is 5', so the volume is `π * r^2 * h` = 3`.14*25*2.5` = 196 cubic feet =
1466 gallons. Make sure you measure the actual depth of water in your
pool rather than relying on the number on the box.

I converted from cubic feet to gallons with the time-honored technique
of typing "196 cubic feet in gallons" into Google.

# Heater
I'm a bit of a nerd and got quite interested in different options for solar pool heating. I'm going to try out something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc78nueDQ64)

Though with a few modifications inspired by [this article](https://www.builditsolar.com/Experimental/OffShelfDHW/Glazing2/GlazingTest2.htm)
specifically the use of the suntuf corrugated polycarbonate for the
glazing which is *way* cheaper than Lexan or any non-corrugated option
I could find.

Given that it's usually pretty hot anyway, you could probably get away
with a pump and couple hundred feet of black irrigation hose laid out
in the sun rather than building the glzed enclosure. The advantage of
a setup like this one, though, is you could actually keep the pool
pretty warm even when it's fairly cold outside (as long as you're
getting sun).


- [Pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012UZYMG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
Some have gone with a solar panel powered pump which is cool and has
some advantages—like the pump will only be on when the sun is shining,
so you won't accidentally leave it on when there's no sun which would
actually cool your pool rather than heating it. The panel +
electronics add enough cost and complexity that I decided I didn't
want to deal with for now.

- [pex piping](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Apollo-1-2-in-x-500-ft-Blue-PEX-Pipe-APPB50012/302341821)

500' is probably going to be way too much on the piping, but for some
reason it was barely twice the cost of 100', so I had to go for it.

We don't have a pool cover right now, but I think we'll want
one... not just to keep crap out, but to keep heat in if we're able to
heat the pool as it gets cooler out.
